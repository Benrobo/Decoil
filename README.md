# Decoil

> Decoild was built during a A 24hrs Hackathon.

The one and only tool you would ever need to ease your `Academics`. Decoil provides a way for student to remain productive during and before an upcoming exams by `Organizing` zoom links for students, `automate` `opening` them. `Never` `miss` a class, never look for `links`. Not just that, It also provide an interface for student to monitor when a particular class would be held by sending the student a mail right to their inbox when a class is about to begin.
